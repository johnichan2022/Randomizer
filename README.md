# Randomizer
Many times we need to change names in text files used for demo to keep the sources. Here you simply find some random names for the names to be replaced in a replacer text and run a python script


generate required number of string from random generator site(eg:https://onlinerandomtools.com/generate-random-string)
paste in replacer.txt with a tab(copy in excel and put back in txt file)
run run_on_dat_files.dat on a python3.7 or above machine
